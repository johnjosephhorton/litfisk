    Inducing Revelation of Vertical Differentiation John J. Horton NYU Stern  Ramesh
     Johari Stanford  Abstract All markets must facilitate coordination: buyers and 
    sellers must know where to find each other to trade goods and services of a cert
    ain type. Notably, market participants naturally have an incentive to disclose i
    nformation about their preferences with respect to horizontal differentiationone
     aspect of the coordination problem. However, the incentive to disclose preferen
    ces with respect to vertical differentiation (quality) is more fraught with stra
    tegic considerations, as it is close to information about willingness-to-pay. Ne
    vertheless we find that endogeneous information disclosure is a powerful tool to
     induce coordination. We investigate a large-scale field experiment in which a t
    ool was introduced to an online labor market that allowed buyers price/quality p
    references to be communicated to sellers. In the treatment cells of the experime
    nt, upon posting a job, buyers chose what price/quality level level they were se
    ek seeking. We find that buyers readily reveal their preferences and this revela
    tionwhich itself was experimentally manipulatedstrongly affected seller-side sor
    ting. However, the strategic concerns of buyers are not second-order: sellers wh
    o learned a buyers preferences substantially altered their bids in the expected 
    direction.

    Despite wanting to receive sellers of the correct type, buyers might be understa
    ndably reluctant to reveal their own type. If buyers have difficulty assessing q
    uality, stating a preference for quality might be unwise: it might lead to the b
    uyer simply seeing the same quality level of offerings but at a higher price. Th
    is of course hinges upon the seller having difficult in ascertaining true qualit
    y ex ante, but this is perhaps they central issue is labor markets. Faced with t
    his possibility, sellers might, for strategic reasons, counter-factually claim a
    verage tastes. In this paper, we consider a market intervention in which buyers 
    in an online labor market were forced to make a claim about their relative prefe
    rence over price and quality. Several different conditions allowed Whether this 
    information was shown to sellers was experimentally manipulated. We test whether
     knowledge that this information While buyers have no qualms about announcing th
    e good or service they are seeking, they are reluctant to announce to sellers th
    eir willingness to pay. One approach to solving this segmentation problem is to 
    make talk costly. For example, the market designer could force buyers to publicl
    y state their relative preferences for price and quality and allow sellers to (h
    opefully) sort. This approach is promising, but buyers might be reluctant to rev
    eal their price-quality trade-off, as revealing a high willingness to pay for qu
    ality could erode their bargaining power with sellers. If buyers are forced to r
    eveal their preference, will they, or will they just pick some default option? D
    o sellers effectively sort, or do they simply exploit the buyers preference reve
    lation to increase prices? In this paper, we describe an experimental interventi
    on that forced some buyers in a matching market to reveal their quality preferen
    ce. It contains a total of 6 experimental groups, each designed to test a specif
    ic hypothesis that will be relevant for wider implementation or modification.  1
