payoffs were an order of magnitude smaller on MTurk compared to the offline lab.
MTurk participants received a $0.50 show-up fee, while offline subjects received
a $5 show-up fee. Each subject was informed that he or she had been randomly assigned to interact with another participant.6 They were further informed that both
players would have a choice between two options, A or B, (where A represents cooperation and B represents defection) with the following payoff structure:

MTurk:

A
B

A
B
$0.70, $0.70
$0, $1.00
$1.00, $0
$0.30, $0.30

Physical lab:

A
B

A
B
$7, $7 $0, $10
$10, $0 $3, $3
(1)

Note that, regardless of the action of ones partner, choosing B maximizes ones
payoff. MTurk workers were additionally given five comprehension questions regarding the payoff structure, allowing us to compare subjects who were paying close attention with those who were not.7
In a one-shot PD, rational self-interested players should always select B. Consistent with a wealth of previous laboratory studies (Camerer 2003), however, a substantial fraction of our subjects chose A, both offline (37%) and on MTurk (47%). The
difference between offline and online cooperation was not statistically significant ( 2
test, p = 0.294), although this may have been in part due to the relatively small offline sample size (N = 30). However, if we restrict our attention to the N = 74 MTurk
subjects who correctly answered all five comprehension questions, we find that 39%
chose A, giving close quantitative agreement with the 37% of cooperating physical
laboratory subjects ( 2 test, p = 0.811). See Fig. 1. These results demonstrate the
ability of MTurk to quantitatively reproduce behavior from the physical laboratory,
and also emphasize the importance of using payoff comprehension questions in the
context of MTurk.
3.3 Qualitative replication: priming
Priming is a common tool in the behavioral sciences. In priming studies, stimuli unrelated to the decision task (and which do not affect the monetary outcomes) can
nonetheless significantly alter subjects behaviors. Priming has attracted a great deal
of attention in psychology, and, more recently, in experimental economics (Benjamin
et al. 2010a). In our second experiment, we demonstrated the power of priming effects on MTurk.
6 MTurk subjects were matched exclusively with MTurk subjects, and offline subjects matched exclusively

with offline subjects.
7 The comprehension questions were: (1) Which earns you more money: [You pick A, You pick B].

(2) Which earns the other person more money: [You pick A, You pick B]. (3) Which earns you more
money: [Other person picks A, Other person picks B]. (4) Which earns the other person more money:
[Other person picks A, Other person pick B]. (5) If you pick B and the other picks A, what bonus will you
receive?
