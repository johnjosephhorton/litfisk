The online laboratory: conducting experiments in a real labor market
Fig. 1 Cooperation level in a
one-shot prisoner’s dilemma is
similar amongst physical
laboratory subjects, MTurk
workers who correctly answered
five payoff comprehension
questions, and all MTurk
workers. Error bars indicate
standard error of the mean

To do so, we recruited 169 subjects to play a PD game. In addition to a $0.20
show-up fee, subjects were further informed of the following payoff structure:

A
B

A
B
$1.20, $1.20 $0.40, $1.60
$1.60, $0.40 $0.80, $0.80

As in the previous PD, A represents cooperation and B represents defection. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the religious prime group (N = 87) or a neutral
prime group (N = 82). The religious prime group read a Christian religious passage
about the importance of charity (Mark 10:17–23) before playing the PD. The neutral prime group instead read a passage of equal length describing three species of
fish before playing the PD. Following the PD, each subject completed a demographic
questionnaire reporting age, gender, country of residence and religious affiliation.
The subjects also indicated whether they had ever had an experience which convinced
them of the existence of God (here called “believers”). Based on previous results using implicit primes with a non-student subject pool (Shariff and Norenzayan 2007),
we hypothesized that the religious prime would increase cooperation, but only among
subjects who had an experience which convinced them of the existence of God.
The results are portrayed in Fig. 2. We analyzed the data using logistic regression
with robust standard errors, with PD decision as the dependent variable (0 = defect,
1 = cooperate), and prime (0 = neutral, 1 = religious) and believer (0 = does not believe in God, 1 = believes in God) as independent variables, along with a prime × believer interaction term. We also included age, gender (0 = female, 1 = male), country
of residence (0 = non-U.S., 1 = U.S.) and religion (0 = non-Christian, 1 = Christian)
as control variables. Consistent with our prediction, we found no significant main effect of prime (p = 0.274) or believer (p = 0.545), but a significant positive interaction between the two (coeff = 1.836, p = 0.008). We also found a significant main
effect of gender (coeff = 0.809, p = 0.028), indicating that women are more likely
to cooperate, but no significant effect of age (p = 0.744), U.S. residency (p = 0.806)
or Christian religion (p = 0.472).
We demonstrated that the religious prime significantly increases cooperation in
the PD, but only among subjects who had an experience which convinced them of
the existence of God. These findings are of particular note given the mixed results
