in order to prevent subjects from simply copying and pasting the text into the text
box. The advantages of a text transcription task are that it (a) is tedious, (b) requires
effort and attention and (c) has a clearly defined quality measure—namely, the number of errors made by subjects (if the true text is known). We have found it useful
to machine-translate the text into some language that is unlikely to be familiar, yet
has no characters unavailable on the standard keyboards. Translating increases the
error rate by ruling out the use of automated spell-checking, and it prevents subjects
from finding the true text somewhere on the web. For this experiment, our text passages were paragraph-sized chunks from Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments,
machine-translated into Tagalog, a language of the Philippines.
In our experiment, after completing the survey and the first task, subjects were
randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups and offered the chance to perform
another transcription for p cents, where p was equal to 1, 5, 15 or 25.
As expected, workers receiving higher offers were more likely to accept. Table 1
shows that as the offered price increased, the fraction of subjects accepting the offer
rose. The regression results are
