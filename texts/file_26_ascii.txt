We have shown that it is possible to replicate, quickly and inexpensively, findings from traditional, physical laboratory experiments in the online laboratory. We
have also argued that experiments conducted in the context of online labor markets
have internal validity and can have external validity. Lastly, we have proposed a number of new and desirable norms and practices that could enhance the usefulness and
credibility of online experimentation. The future appears bright for the online laboratory, and we predict thatas the NetLab workshop quotation in our introduction
suggeststhe social sciences are primed for major scientific advances.
